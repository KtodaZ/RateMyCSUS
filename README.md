###Revision History
- v1.2.8: Removed browsing history / browsing activity requirement. Fixed issue some users were having in displaying ratings

###Disclaimer:
The ratings shown are owned by RateMyProfessor and not me.
I am not responsible for any problems using the cmsweb system, you not being able to choose classes, or this extension stealing your girlfriend - you must use this extension at your own risk.

###How does it work?
Every time you load a page on your schools website, the extension searches for professor names. If a name exists it adds a link to each professors name that dynamically loads that professors ratings on mouse over. This is all done through javascript locally.
